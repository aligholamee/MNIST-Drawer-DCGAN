Implementation of a deep convolutional generative adversarial network to draw MNIST characters using Tensorflow. This [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-a-generative-adversarial-network-gan-dcgan-to-draw-human-faces-8291616904a) from the **TowardsDataScience** community helped me to understand and build this awesome digit drawer.

## Contribution
Its been a long time since training with a Nvidia 850 GTX. Be **careful!**.
